              Born in Kenya and raised in the lively streets of Luanda, I'm a
              blend of cultures with a knack for humor and a passion for all
              things tech. When I'm not geeking out over the latest gadgets,
              you'll find me chasing adrenaline—whether it's skydiving, mountain
              biking, or surfing. Extreme sports fuel my spirit, and I'm always
              up for the next thrill. Life's too short not to have fun, so I
              keep it light, adventurous, and full of laughs!

            <p>
              I was born in Nairobi, Kenya, where the only thing faster than a
              Serengeti cheetah was my curiosity about how things worked. At the
              age of 8, my family moved to Luanda, Angola, where I discovered
              that technology wasn't just a tool—it was a superhero that could
              save the day. I spent my childhood tinkering with gadgets, trying
              (and failing) to make my own version of Iron Man's suit. Spoiler:
              it didn't quite fly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fast forward to now, and my love for breaking things apart and
              fixing them has evolved into a passion for backend software
              engineering. I realized that if I could build systems that could
              make cities smarter or help manage resources more efficiently, I'd
              be on my way to becoming a real-life tech superhero (minus the
              cape, of course).

              Goals for the Program - Becoming a Software Sorcerer
            </summary>
            <p>
              I'm joining the School of Engineering's backend software
              engineering program to level up my coding superpowers. I'm ready
              to dive into creating scalable, efficient software that could help
              tackle big problems—like making traffic less terrible, or maybe
              even building a smart city (no flying suits… yet). Ultimately, I
              want to be part of the next wave of tech innovators who are using
              code to make life better, faster, and more sustainable.
